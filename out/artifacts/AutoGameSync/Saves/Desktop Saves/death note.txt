Lucas's suicide note

Please look inside my mattress under my left pillow location,
(may require a knife) once opened you will find 7 tapes.
The first 6 are double sided and hold 2 recordings, please
listen to them in order and dont skip them, all the information
included in them is vital. The tapes contain the very reasons
behind my sudden death and the individuals that are responsible
for my actions. Once all 13 tapes are listened to, the next
step of the puzzle begins.
